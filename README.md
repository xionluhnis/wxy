# wxy
Personal Content Management System using raw file storage, templating and markdown content in a modular way

## About wxy
wxy is built upon [PicoCMS](http://picocms.org) modular file-based content management system:

* **Modulare**: plugins can be created that hook to each of the main parts of the page generation:
* **Simple**: make it as simple as possible, but not simpler; less is more
* **File-based**: no database is required, files store what they should, such as images, text (markdown) or parameters (json)
* **Templated**: use of [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates

## Page hooks

1. **Plugin loading**: the many different plugins are loaded
2. **Configuration loading**: the configuration is loaded (resolution from the url)
3. **Url request treatment**: the routing is made (plugins can do big work here)

Unless any plugin decides to take over the content processing, the page is then
generated by loading the necessary content:
4. *Content loading*: content loading
5. *Metadata loading*: metadata loading
6. *Content parsing*: content transformation (markdown to html)
7. *Index generation*: the index of pages

Finally, it is generated with Twig:
8. **Page rendering**

## TODO

* Have the default ´get_page´ working.
* Create plugin to have a full index of files (.md => pages, .png/.jpg/.gif => image display, other => downloadable file)
* Integrate *json* for parameters
* Create themes and deploy
