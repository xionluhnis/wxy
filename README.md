# wxy
Personal Content Management System using raw file storage, templating and markdown content in a modular way

## About wxy
wxy is built upon [PicoCMS](http://picocms.org) modular file-based content management system:

* **Modulare**: plugins can be created that hook to each of the main parts of the page generation:
* **Simple**: make it as simple as possible, but not simpler; less is more
* **File-based**: no database is required, files store what they should, such as images, text (markdown) or parameters (json)
* **Templated**: use of [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templates

## Page hooks

1. **Plugin loading**: the many different plugins are loaded
2. **Configuration loading**: the configuration is loaded (resolution from the url)
3. **Url request treatment**: the routing is made (plugins can do big work here)

Unless any plugin decides to take over the content processing, the page is then
generated by 4. parsing the necessary content, 5. creating an index and 6. generating the page from the template.

* *Content loading*: content loading
* *Metadata loading*: metadata loading
* *Content parsing*: content transformation (markdown to html)
* *Index generation*: the index of pages
* **Page rendering**: rendering of the template with the given data

## TODO

* Have the default `get_page` working.
* Create plugin to have a full index of files (.md => pages, .png/.jpg/.gif => image display, other => downloadable file)
* Integrate *json* for parameters
* Create themes and deploy
